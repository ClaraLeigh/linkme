# LinkMe - Information sharing without databases

Welcome to LinkMe! This tool is designed as a proof of concept, where messages and links can be stored in the URL instead of the website itself. This could be used simple links or could even be a way to share information without a database.

## Features

- **Compression**: Replace common phrases and terms with shorter, predefined tokens to reduce the length of the bio text.
- **Decompression**: Convert compressed tokens back to their original phrases for readability and use.
- **Flexible Token Handling**: Ensures that special characters are used to denote substitutions, preventing accidental replacements.

## Possible Improvements

I think there are a few more techniques that could be used to improve the compression and decompression process. For example, we could use a bigger dictionary of common phrases and terms to replace, or we could use a more advanced algorithm to compress the text. We could also add more features to the tool, such as the ability to create a qr code from the compressed text, or the ability to share the compressed text on social media.

## Who is responsible for moderation?

This raises some interesting questions about who is responsible for the content of a website. If none of the data is stored on the site itself, does that mean the site owner is not responsible for the content? Could this be used by websites to avoid moderation and accountability?
